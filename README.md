# MQTT plugin for the Decent Espresso DE1+

This plugin adds MQTT support to DE1+ machines.  It supports publishing status
information to MQTT, as well as receiving commands to wake the device or put it
to sleep.

See [docs/topics.md](docs/topics.md) for a description of the topics.

## Settings

Most settings are configurable through the settings UI in the app.

A few settings can only be configured by manually uploading files or editing
the `settings.tdb` file by plugging the tablet into a computer.

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for more detailed documentation of the
settings.
